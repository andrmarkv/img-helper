IMPLEMENTED:
3. not circle but elipse
7. add command that would allow capture screens - not needed adb screencap is good enough
5. implement collect mode only
10. perform clear bag
11. storee images of captured pokemons with attempt count
12. Implement exit from stuck in gyms (walk close...)
13. Implement signal to another controller
22. optimize catching pokm, instead of waiting for 10 seconds keep checking screen and proceeding to proper action if possible
15. do toches from center to outside first and then reverse - this is to have more chances to find something if standing next to gym
17. time based catching pokemon - pause is too long
18. fix pokemon run away situation that goes to shopping screen
21. fix error of message desyncronization ERROR! got wrong msgId in response 1849/1848 (happens after receive timeout)


NOT IMPLEMENTED:
1. implement check if any pokemon was caught and if it is keep clicking - main idea is to make sure that we got all of them around stop
2. perform map rotation - that is to handle situations where gym covers big portion of the screen
4. detect when pokemon is shifted left or right
6. implement classification of pokemons
8. join gyms when possible
9. perform periodic restarts
14. check if returning same screen again and again - means too close to gym
16. if got pokemon in the sector repeat secrot again, if gym or stop do not repeat
19. recognize letters to verify what pokemon we are catching and create exception lists
20. try to identify gyms, active pokestops and pokemons on the main screen so be able to program touches
22. Evenly distribute dots (create matrix, select and remember dots for the sectors)
